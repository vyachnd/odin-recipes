# ODIN RECIPES

Hello, I'm ***Vyacheslav*** and I'm a **beginner+** in programming. I want to become a **Front-End developer**. I'm studying on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). I also study English, but now I don't know it well.

I'm doing an **[Odin Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)** project at the moment.
