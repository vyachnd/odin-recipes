    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love fried chicken, but it takes so long and is such a big mess. I came up with this oven-fried version, and have been making it ever since! Everyone I have given the recipe to has loved it as well.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place flour in a shallow plate or bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Put bread crumbs in another shallow plate or bowl and beat eggs in another bowl.</li>
      <li>Dredge chicken piece by piece in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs, until all pieces are coated.</li>
      <li>Pour oil into a large baking dish; add the breaded chicken thighs and sprinkle with paprika to taste.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then turn pieces over and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and drain on paper towels.</li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
