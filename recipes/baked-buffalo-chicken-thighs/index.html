    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken wings are delightful, but these baked Buffalo chicken thighs improve the meat to bone ratio dramatically. If you want a meal, try using bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs for a hearty, spicy main dish. If you serve them with carrot and celery strips on Romaine leaves, you'll sneak in a salad, before your family will know it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>olive oil spray</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/3 cup hot sauce, such as Frank&#39;s&reg; RedHot&reg; Original</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic granules</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>Romaine lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups carrot sticks</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups celery sticks</li>
      <li>1 cup ranch dressing, or as needed</li>
      <li>fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.</li>
      <li>Trim excess skin and fat from thighs and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken thighs in a 1-gallon resealable plastic bag.</li>
      <li>Stir together salt, pepper, and baking powder in a small bowl until well blended. Add seasonings to the bag. Seal the bag; shake and move chicken around to evenly coat with seasonings.</li>
      <li>Place seasoned chicken thighs on the prepared pan, skin side up, and spray with olive oil spray.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken skin is brown and crispy, chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 40 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and cayenne. Remove from heat and keep warm.</li>
      <li>Remove chicken from the oven; brush thighs evenly with hot sauce mixture.</li>
      <li>Serve on a bed of Romaine leaves, with fresh carrot and celery sticks, and ranch dressing for dipping. Garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>
